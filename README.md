<h1>SUMMARY</h1>
<hr>
<h4>This project listens to your voice and opens new tabs based on what you ask for, like WhatsApp, a calculator, or Google search. It's being improved to understand commands better by adjusting the way it listens. With this, you can easily switch between tasks using just your voice, making browsing and using tools much easier.</h4>
